We silmulate the spatial Lambda-Fleming-Viot-Model. 

This is a half discrete and half continuous model which describes two competing species distributed in the 2D plane (or any other dimensions). Then reproduction events take place according to a Poisson point process and involve balls of fixed radius.

Motivation for this simulation was the study of the scaling limit (with the radius chosen to converge to zero in a suitable manner) of the
particle system:

In the pictures white equal distribution of the two populations. Red a higher presence of one, blue of the other population.
